Project: Salary Prediction and Loan Decision Using Tabular Model
Objective
This project aims to predict whether an individual's annual salary is below or above 50k using a Tabular Model. Decisions are made based on personal and professional characteristics of the individual. Additionally, this model can assist in making decisions regarding loan approvals.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Adult Income Dataset, which contains the following information:
* Personal attributes such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, and others.
* The target column: Salary - this column indicates whether the individual's annual income is below 50k (class 0) or equal to/above 50k (class 1).
Libraries Used
The following libraries were used in the project:
1. pandas: For reading and manipulating data.
2. fastai: A deep learning library used for working with tabular data.
Process
1. Data Loading:
o Data was automatically downloaded using untar_data and stored in a CSV file.
2. Creating DataLoaders:
o The TabularDataLoaders class was used to load data from the CSV file.
o Data was organized into categorical and continuous variables:
* Categorical variables: workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex.
* Continuous variables: age, fnlwgt, education-num, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week.
o Preprocessing steps like Categorify, FillMissing, and Normalize were applied to prepare the data.
3. Training the Model:
o A model was built using the Tabular Learner class.
o The model was trained using the accuracy metric.
o The fit_one_cycle method was used to train the model for 4 epochs.
4. Testing the Model:
o To test the model, the row df.iloc[4] from the dataset was used, and the predicted result (0, tensor([0.8206, 0.1794])) was obtained.
o This result indicates that if the annual salary is less than 50k, the model classifies it as class 0 (negative), and if the salary is 50k or more, it classifies it as class 1 (positive).
5. Displaying Results:
o The model's results were visualized using the learn.show_results method.
Results
1. Model Performance:
o The model accurately predicted whether the salary is below or above 50k.
2. Example Prediction:
o Input: df.iloc[4] data row.
o Output: 0 (Salary below 50k)
3. Loan Decisions:
o The model can be used to make decisions regarding loan approvals based on the provided data.
Conclusions
1. Model Training:
o The model proved to be effective in accurately predicting annual salaries and can assist in making data-driven decisions.
2. Loan Decision Making:
o This model can be used to assist in making decisions about who to approve loans for, based on the data provided.
3. Practical Applications:
o The model can be extended to other business domains, such as making decisions about customers, creating marketing strategies, and more.
