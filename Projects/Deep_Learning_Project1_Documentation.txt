Project: Identifying Cats Using Artificial Neural Networks
Objective
This project was undertaken to enhance knowledge of Deep Learning techniques. The primary goal is to create a model that can identify cats in images using artificial neural networks. The model is based on transfer learning techniques, leveraging the power of pre-trained models.
About the Model
The project uses the pre-trained ResNet34 model. This model, trained on approximately 1.3 million images, demonstrates high accuracy in image recognition tasks.
Dataset
The model was trained using the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, which includes:
* 7,349 images of cats and dogs.
* Correctly labeled images for training.
Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized in this project:
1. torch - For building and deploying artificial neural networks.
2. fastai - To simplify the process of model training and analysis.
3. ipywidgets - For creating interactive user interface elements.
Processes
1. Downloading and Preparing the Dataset
o The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset was downloaded automatically.
o A labeling function (label_func) was created to classify cats and dogs based on the first letter of the image filename:
* If the first letter is uppercase, it represents a cat.
* If the first letter is lowercase, it represents a dog.
2. Creating Data Loaders
o All images were resized to 224x224 pixels to ensure uniformity.
o The dataset was split into 80% training data and 20% validation data.
3. Training the Model
o The ResNet34 model was fine-tuned using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
o The model was trained for 2 epochs, improving its accuracy with fine-tuning.
4. Uploading Files and Making Predictions
o Using ipywidgets FileUpload, users can upload an image.
o The model accepts the uploaded image and predicts whether it is a cat or a dog.
o The prediction confidence is displayed as a percentage.
Results
* The model accurately identifies whether the uploaded image contains a cat or a dog.
* Each prediction includes a confidence score, presented as a percentage.
