Drug Recommendation System Using Classification Algorithms
The objective of this project is to study and implement classification algorithms to predict the most suitable drug for a patient. The project leverages data on patients suffering from the same disease and creates a model to recommend the appropriate drug. The problem is solved using multiclass classification.
The model is built using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.
Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following information:
· Features: Patient characteristics such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators.
· Outcome: The recommended drug type (drugA, drugB, drugC, drugX, or drugY).
Libraries Used
The following Python libraries and tools were utilized:
1. numpy: For mathematical and statistical calculations.
2. pandas: For data management and analysis.
3. sklearn:
o DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier: Classification algorithms.
o LabelEncoder: For encoding categorical data into numeric format.
o train_test_split: For splitting data into training and testing sets.
o classification_report and confusion_matrix: For evaluating model performance.
o cross_val_predict: For cross-validation-based predictions.
4. seaborn and matplotlib: For visualization.
1. Data Preprocessing
· Categorical data was converted to numeric format using LabelEncoder.
· Features were standardized (if necessary).
· The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
2. Model Development
Decision Tree Classifier
· The model was built using DecisionTreeClassifier.
· The accuracy of the model on test data was 95%.
· Cross-validation results were analyzed.
Random Forest Classifier
· The RandomForestClassifier algorithm was also implemented.
· The model was evaluated using cross-validation, and the results were recorded.
The model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
1. Precision: The percentage of correctly identified instances for each drug type.
2. Recall: The proportion of correctly identified outcomes out of the actual occurrences.
3. F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
4. Accuracy: The overall proportion of correctly classified instances.

Confusion matrices were generated for both models to visually assess the accuracy of predictions.
The Decision Tree model performed better with an accuracy of 98%.
The Random Forest model achieved 94% accuracy, making it suitable for generalization while maintaining high performance.
Both models demonstrated high effectiveness in solving the multiclass classification problem.
